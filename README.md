# Smartwatch Anomaly Detection

## A Bluetooth Intrusion Detection Prototyped using AI/ML

### Using [Logistic Regression](https://www.ibm.com/topics/logistic-regression) and [Standard Scaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)

- An AI-powered Bluetooth intrusion detection system for smartwatches.
- This project focuses on research on security issues in relation with smartwatch or any other wearable devices, and contains an intelligent algorithm that detects and prevents unauthorized Bluetooth connections, ensuring the security and privacy of smartwatch users.

For details, see the documentation [here](https://github.com/joe-boadi/bluetooth-intrusion-detection) in my Github repository.

This project is only an extension of the [Bluetooth Intrusion Detection](https://github.com/joe-boadi/bluetooth-intrusion-detection) project adding web-UI features.
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) is incorporated with this extension
